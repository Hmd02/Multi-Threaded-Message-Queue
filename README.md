# Custom Priority Queue with Thread-Safe Messaging

This repository contains a Python script implementing a custom priority queue with thread-safe messaging. Threads can send messages to the queue with specified priorities, and receiving threads are awakened when messages are available.

## Installation

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hmd02/Multi-Threaded-Message-Queue.git

2. **Open Terminal in Current directory:**

3. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Multi-Threaded-Message-Queue
   
4. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python multiThread.py

This command will execute the Python script, which demonstrates the functionality of the custom priority queue with multiple threads.

## Usage

The script provides a simple demonstration of sending and receiving messages between threads using the custom priority queue. Each thread sends a message with a specified priority, and receiving threads are awakened to process the messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
